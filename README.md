### Hey I'm Dan!

* I graduated in accounting and **wrote code to automate over 85% of my work at my first job**. I've been a software engineer ever since.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) are my weapons of choice.
* I learn by **building** so I like to tackle [side projects](https://danseethaler.medium.com/8-super-power-side-projects-ddb90e2b88fd).
* I've led several engineering teams and love to provide technical mentorship.

Here is a taste of apps that I've designed and built.
